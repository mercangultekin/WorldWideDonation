Reliability
We tested all the steps of the software, we developed it with different inputs and tried to improve the experience of the user by fixing 
all the mistakes. We tested the system after every new feature we added. When we encountered any problem, we figured out where we made a 
mistake.

Expandability
While designing our system, we paid attention to extensibility. Thanks to its modular structure, our system is ready for new technologies 
that can be added later.

Programmability
In our project, we tried to create a simple, functional product using the ASP.NET Framework. The reason we use the Framework is that simple
operations such as logging in and signing up are readily available and accordingly we can spend more time on other important parts of the 
software.

Availability
Availability is the ratio of time a system or component is functional to the total time it is required or expected to function. The system 
we developed must be accessible 24/7 and we designed it this way.

Compatibility
Another reason why we use the ASP.NET MVC framework in our project is that it helped us about compatibility and it has provided us with 
the following advantages:
It made  easier to manage the mix by dividing the application into model, view, and controller
It was better support for test-based development.
