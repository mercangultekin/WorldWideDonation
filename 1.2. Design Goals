* WWD system is designed to be used easily. Any user who knows their Username and password can use the system and perform operations.

* User interface should be designed for any user to accomplish their operations with basic, simple and understandable steps. In addition to 
  the registered users, visitor users can use search and information parts.

* The system should not allow unauthorized users to access user information and operations. To maintain the security of the system, 
  the system is designed as not accessible to operations that are offered to users without login into the accounts by exclusive Username 
  and Password.

* The system can handle expected exceptions such as invalid input by showing the user a related message and asking the user to enter the 
  input again.
  
* To avoid any discomfort, the system should keep the persistent data correctly.

* The system architecture is designed to be readable by other programmers. Because of the subsystem decomposition, it is easy to adapt 
  changes and new functions without the much need of recompile the code.
