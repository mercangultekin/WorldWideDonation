Start Up: When the system is first deployed to a web server it is started by the developers of the system. By this operation system already
has an administrative account added to database by manually. Client is given this admin account if requests. After these operations the 
system is started and user only has to visit the web page of the WWDS on his/her device. 
 
Shut Down: When shutdown requested by admin, the server terminates all ongoing operations shuts down the system. No data gets corrupted. 
All critical and crucial data are stored in system database. 
 
In WWDS, five major exceptions might be arisen: 
 
    Invalid input exception in which the input entered by the Users during transactions does not match the wanted conditions. 
  
    Non-existence of the input exception in which the input entered by the Users during transactions does not exist in the system. 
  
    Already exist/selected input exception in which the transaction performed by the Users has already performed.  
  
    Incomplete input exception in which the input entered by the Users during transactions is not sufficient to end the transaction successfully. 
  
    Server crashes exception in which WWDS server is unexpectedly terminated. 
 
 
 We decided to handle the first four, input related, exceptions as showing a message that explains the failure of the transaction to the 
 Users. Then the system will ask the Users to enter the correct input to end the operation successfully.
