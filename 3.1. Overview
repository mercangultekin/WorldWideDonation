 
In this section we will introduce a main structure of the system and describe the main aspects of the design how system will perform. 
This section also provides a short explanation about each component and process to be developed under the Worldwide Donation System project.
So this section includes, decomposition of the main system into subsystem, how these subsystems connect with each other, data management, 
access control, control flow and boundary conditions of the system in case of errors and characteristics of the services provided by the 
subsystem.
