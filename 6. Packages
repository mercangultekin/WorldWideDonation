A package is a grouping mechanism for organizing elements into groups to increase their readability. In other words, it is a grouping of 
model elements, such as use cases, or activities, defining scopes of understanding. Packages are used to deal with complexity in the same 
way a user organizes files and subdirectories into directories.
